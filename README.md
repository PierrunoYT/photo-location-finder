## üåü Features

- **EXIF Data Extraction**: Extracts GPS coordinates from image metadata.
- **Google Vision API Integration**: Detects landmarks, labels, web entities, and more from images.
- **Reverse Geocoding**: Converts GPS coordinates into human-readable addresses using Google Maps API.
- **Street View**: Provides a street view image of the location.
- **Web Interface**: Allows users to upload and process images via a simple web interface.

   ```

4. **Configure Google API Credentials**

   a. Create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   b. Enable the Vision API and Maps API for your project.
   c. Create API credentials (API key and service account key).
   d. Create a `config.json` file based on `config.json.template` and fill in your Google API credentials and other configurations.

   ```json
   {
     "google_api_key": "YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE",
     "google_application_credentials_file_path": "PATH_TO_YOUR_GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_FILE",
     "image_directory_path": "PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE_DIRECTORY"
   }
   ```

5. **Set up the Upload Directory**

   Create a directory named `uploads` in the project root:

   ```bash
   mkdir uploads
   ```

6. **Run the Application**
